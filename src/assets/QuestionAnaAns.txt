Answer Key & Explanations
1. D) 1 is the multiplicative identity, not the additive identity. The additive identity is 0.
2. B) The product of three negative integers is negative. 5 \times 4 \times 3 = 60, and an odd number of negatives results in a negative sign.
3. A) She got 10 correct, scoring 10 \times 5 = 50 marks. Her final score was 30, so she lost 20 marks. Since each incorrect answer is -2, she got 20 \div 2 = 10 incorrect answers.
4. C) The distributive property states that a(b + c) = ab + ac. This matches the equation perfectly.
5. A) First, solve the bracket: (-36) \div 12 = -3. Then, divide the result by 3: (-3) \div 3 = -1.
6. A) (-1) + (-2) = -3.
7. A) The additive inverse of a number x is -x, such that their sum is 0. The inverse of -8 is 8.
8. A) Total drop required is from +10 to -8, which is a change of 18^{\circ}\text{C}. Rate is 2^{\circ}\text{C}/hour. Time = 18/2 = 9 hours. 12 noon + 9 hours = 9 PM.
9. A) There are 4 negative integers in the product. Since 4 is an even number, the product is positive. The reason correctly explains the assertion.
10. D) The assertion is false because division by zero is undefined, not zero. The reason statement is factually true.
11. B) Product of a negative and a positive is negative: 6 \times 5 = 30, so -30.
12. A) (-25) \times (-1) = 25.
13. C) The pattern increases by 1 each step: -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1. So (-1) \times (-1) = 1.
14. B) Using BODMAS: First brackets (4+6)=10. Then multiply 5 \times 10 = 50. Finally subtract 25 - 50 = -25.
15. B) (-3) \times (-9) = 27. Two negatives make a positive.
16. A) The grouping of factors changes, which is the definition of associativity.
17. B) Distance = Upper position - Lower position = 5000 - (-1200) = 5000 + 1200 = 6200\text{ m}.
18. B) Unlike signs in division always yield a negative result.
19. A) (-48) \div 48 = -1. Any number divided by its additive inverse gives -1.
20. D) Result is a fraction/decimal (approx -2.33), which is not an integer.
